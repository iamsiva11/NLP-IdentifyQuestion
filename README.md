# Project Title

Given a question, the aim is to identify the category it belongs to. The four 
categories to handle for this assignmentare : Who, What, When, Affirmation(yes/no).

Example:
1. What is your name? Type: What
2. When is the show happening? Type: When
3. Is there a cab available for airport? Type: Affirmation
There are ambiguous cases to handle as well like:
What time does the train leave(this looks like a what question but is actually a When type)
